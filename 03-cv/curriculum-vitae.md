# Petra Železná
## Product Photographer and Graphic Designer
I was born in Czech Republic and have been always occupied by art and creative thoughts. Even though my designer path started in my mid-teens, untill then I have been interested in painting, drawing, creative writing. I have spent my childhood with a camera and I still enjoy shooting, especially product photography. In my free time you may find me reading or at the barn where I spend most of my free time taking care of horses and also giving lessons.
My design style is clear, informative but also eye-catching and esthetically pleasing.
