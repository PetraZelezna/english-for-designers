Chapter VI

Copying is a sensitive theme for some, but I believe it affects our everyday lives, even though we may not notice it at first. You can talk a short walk down the street and you get inspired and encouraged by many things. It can be the most random thing, like a billboard placed by the street. It can also be a beautiful view from your living room window, which can inspire you to start painting landscapes again or to remember, how much you love greens and to include them in your next project. The smallest things like that can have a long butterfly effect.

Inspiration is all around us. Copying can also be perceived in many different forms. I never knowingly copy someone else's graphic design or other work. I get inspired by it and always try to pick precise points and I then try to include these points in my work. I can learn a lot of different techniques this way. Whenever I see a great-looking catalogue I notice the little details such as the image placement, whether they chose a thin font or not and how much space there is in between the letters. In my next projects, I then use similar design tweaks to try how it looks when I put it into my work.

I wouldn`t say copying is bad because I can study and learn from it and as a result of that I believe I`m a better graphic designer.
