I like to think of myself as a minimalist designer, but that doesnâ€™t mean I overlook the finest details ,which are important for a great design.

I'm known to be obsessed with my two beloved horses, but I also really like photography, pumpkin-spice lattes, and lazy days when I can finally have time to read books while listening to my favorite music or TV shows.
