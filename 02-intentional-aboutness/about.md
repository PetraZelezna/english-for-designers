I like to think of myself as a minimalist designer, but that doesnâ€™t mean I overlook the finest details ,which are important for a great design.

I'm known to be obsessed with my two beloved horses, but I also really like photography, pumpkin-spice lattes, and lazy days when I can finally have time to read books while listening to my favorite music or TV shows.

*(Minimalist description: Great design doesn't necessarily have to include countless little illustrations in a comprehensive and detailed graphic. It stands out from the crowd because it solves the problem. It is easily understandable by the audience that feels precisely what the designer wants it to feel. 
When it comes to minimalism, I try to capture the core message by using as little distractive elements as possible and still delivering a great-looking design.)*
